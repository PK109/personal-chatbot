e-commerce-workflow is an open-source data pipeline template for processing e-commerce data on Google Cloud Platform. It automates infrastructure setup, data ingestion, transformation, and prepares data for visualization in BI tools like Looker Studio.
Goals
-Automate setup of GCP infrastructure for analytics.
-Utilize dbt to transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets.
-Provide a modular, open-source template that can be reused, extended, or customized for similar e-commerce data processing use cases.
Key Features
-Infrastructure-as-Code: Uses Terraform to provision GCP resources (Compute Engine, BigQuery, GCS)
-Workflow Orchestration: Kestra manages data extraction, ingestion, and transformation flows.
-Data Transformation: dbt builds and tests data models.
-Visualization Ready: Output is ready for BI dashboards.
-Modular Project Structure 	Organized directories (terraform/, kestra/, dbt/, spark/) for different pipeline components.
-Cloud-Native and Scalable: Built to run on GCP and leverage cloud scalability.
-Automated Setup Scripts: Shell scripts and detailed setup instructions for deploying and validating the infrastructure and data workflows.
Architecture Overview
Terraform provisions GCP resources.
Kestra orchestrates flows:
-Extracts and uploads raw data to GCS.
-Ingests data to BigQuery and triggers dbt jobs.
dbt transforms data for analytics.
Data is then accessible for BI tools.
Pipeline Flow:
-Extract Raw Data: Download raw data files from a server, split by day, and upload to GCS.
-Batch Extraction: Helper workflow for bulk extraction.
-Ingest to BigQuery: Triggered automatically when files land in GCS; loads data into BigQuery and runs dbt transformations.
-Dashboard Ready: Once the pipeline completes, data is ready for dashboarding in Looker Studio or similar tools.
